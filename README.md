# pose-estimation
The Github repository provides a solution to a hackathon challenge presented by IITMR that aims to ensure correct handling of objects in industries. The solution includes a program that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze images and identify if the objects are being handled correctly or not. 
 The solution is based on the YOLOv7 algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that uses deep neural networks to detect objects in images and videos. The solution includes a Python script called "detect.py" that uses the YOLOv7 algorithm to detect poses in a given video file. To run the solution, you need to create a Conda environment called "yolov7_pose" and install the required Python packages using pip. Once the environment is set up, you can run the "detect.py" script with the appropriate command-line arguments to detect poses in a given video file.
