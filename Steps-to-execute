conda create -n yolov7_pose
This command creates a new Conda environment called "yolov7_pose".
A Conda environment is a self-contained workspace that can contain its own packages, dependencies, and configurations. Creating a new environment is often a good practice when working with Python because it allows you to isolate the dependencies for different projects.

conda activate yolov7_pose
This command activates the newly created "yolov7_pose" environment, which sets up the environment to use the packages and dependencies installed within that environment.

pip install -r requirements.txt
This command installs the Python packages listed in the "requirements.txt" file. This file typically contains a list of all the packages needed to run the YOLOv7 pose detection program.

pip install pycocotools
This command installs the Python API for the Microsoft COCO dataset, which is used for object detection and segmentation tasks.
The YOLOv7 pose detection program uses this package to load the COCO keypoint labels and perform other tasks related to object detection.

pip install onnxruntime==1.10.0
This command installs the ONNX Runtime package, which is used for high-performance inference of machine learning models.
The YOLOv7 pose detection program uses this package to perform inference on the trained YOLOv7 model.

python detect.py --weights yolov7-w6-pose.pt --kpt-label --hide-labels --hide-conf --source football1.mp4 --line-thickness 10
This command runs the YOLOv7 pose detection program. The "detect.py" script is the main entry point for the program. 
The "--weights" flag specifies the location of the trained YOLOv7 model weights file.
The "--kpt-label", "--hide-labels", and "--hide-conf" flags control the display of output labels and confidence scores.
The "--source" flag specifies the input video file to be processed. 
The "--line-thickness" flag controls the thickness of the lines drawn on the output video to indicate the detected poses.
